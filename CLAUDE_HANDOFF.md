# Claude Handoff Document - Puzzle Daily

Last Updated: March 24, 2026

## Project Overview

**Puzzle Daily** (branded "Knightly") is a React/TypeScript turn-based puzzle game platform with a medieval dungeon theme. It features a full editor suite and a player-facing game.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dungeon-themed palette
- **Canvas Rendering**: Custom canvas-based AnimatedGameBoard (no Pixi.js)
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for cloud puzzles, daily scheduling
- **Hosting**: Netlify (editor at knightly-dev, player at separate site)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Jantzulu/puzzle-daily.git

### Projectile System (CRITICAL - read carefully)

The projectile system was extensively refactored for determinism. Here is how it works:

**Two-phase architecture:**
1. **`resolveProjectiles()`** (in simulation.ts) - runs at turn boundaries inside `executeTurn()`. Deterministic collision resolution. Advances projectiles logically, checks hits, applies damage, handles reflect. Sets `hitResult` on projectiles for visual consumption.
2. **`updateProjectiles()`** (in simulation.ts) - runs per-frame in AnimatedGameBoard's animation loop. Visual-only: interpolates projectile positions, consumes `hitResult` when visual reaches the target, spawns VFX.

**Key design decisions:**
- Non-homing projectiles get their `tilePath` at spawn time (via `computeTilePathWithWallLookahead`). `resolveProjectiles` does NOT overwrite `tilePath` - it only updates `logicalTileIndex` and sets `hitResult`.
- Homing straight-line projectiles use `homingVisualStartX/Y/Time` for smooth interpolation from spawn to target, independent of `resolveProjectiles`.
- Reflected projectiles use a combined approach+reflect `tilePath` with `reflectAtTileIndex` for tint switching. `reflectProjectile()` clears `homingVisualStartX/Y/Time` so reflected projectiles use tile-by-tile animation.
- `visualTileIndex` is calculated from time (`elapsed / tileTransitTime`), NOT from a stored `currentTileIndex`. This avoids deep-copy mutation issues.
- `pendingDeactivation` flag replaces `active = false` for end-of-range, letting the visual system control deactivation timing.
- `pendingProjectileDeath` defers entity death until the projectile visual arrives. `visualHealth` defers HP bar changes similarly.

**Known issues / pending work:**
- Slow homing projectiles (speed 1-2) have visual issues - they do not smoothly track moving targets. The straight-line interpolation was designed for fast projectiles. Attempts to fix (per-frame following, cumulative distance) broke fast projectiles. The slow homing fix needs a separate visual path that does not affect fast projectiles.
- Replays show projectiles via an event timeline system (`projectileTimeline` in Game.tsx). Events are recorded during headless replay generation. `buildReplayProjectiles()` reconstructs projectile visuals from events. Step-by-step replay works with animation + freeze. Some edge cases remain with slow projectiles in replays.
- The projectile system has technical debt: multiple overlapping flags (`pendingDeactivation`, `pendingProjectileDeath`, `hitResult`, `visualHealth`), duplicated collision logic between `resolveProjectiles` and `updateProjectilesHeadless`, and the visual system still mutates `proj.x/y` and `proj.currentTileIndex` on game state objects (deep copy captures these).

### Reflect Status Effect

The Reflect status effect bounces incoming projectiles back:
- `reflectProjectile()` reverses direction, swaps team targeting (`teamSwapped`), applies tint
- Directional filter: `reflectDirections` on StatusEffectAsset (front/back/left/right checkboxes)
- `canReflectDirection()` checks if projectile approach angle matches allowed zones
- Reflected projectiles cannot bounce again (`proj.reflected = true`)
- Combined approach+reflect visual path with `reflectAtTileIndex` for tint timing
- `visualPastReflectPoint` boolean prevents glow/tint flickering
- Separate `reflectImpactSprite` for the bounce VFX (distinct from projectile override sprite)
- Reflect impact VFX is deferred via `pendingReflectVfx` until visual reaches reflect point

### Stealth Status Effect

- Stealthed entities cannot trigger opposing team's proximity/range/contact triggers
- Cannot be auto-targeted by homing projectiles
- Same-team entities CAN still see stealthed allies
- `isEntityStealthed()` helper in actions.ts

### Steadfast Status Effect

- Prevents entity from being affected by any redirect effects (spell, item, or tile)
- `isSteadfast()` helper checked at all redirect application sites

### Redirect Spell System

- Projectile that changes target's facing direction on hit
- Modes: clockwise, counter_clockwise, face_projectile, face_away, fixed
- Player-choosable direction: `redirectAcceptsUserInput` flag, compass UI in CharacterSelector
- `spellDirectionOverrides` on PlacedCharacter, `pendingSpellDirectionOverrides` for pre-placement
- Also available as collectible effect and tile behavior

### Initial Status Effects

- Characters and enemies can start with status effects configured in their asset editors
- `initialStatusEffects` array on Character/Enemy types
- Duration override (-1 = permanent/99999 turns)
- Applied during character placement (heroes) and `initializeGameState()` (enemies)

### Spell Types

- `MELEE` / `MELEE_CONE` - close-range attacks
- `LINEAR` (was MAGIC_LINEAR, RANGE_LINEAR merged) - projectile in a line
- `REDIRECT` - changes target's facing direction
- `RESURRECT` - revives dead allies
- `PUSH` - pushes target tiles away
- `THROW_PLACE` - place or throw a collectible item onto a tile (see below)
- Backstab: per-spell toggle for 2x damage from behind (`isAttackFromBehind()` in utils.ts)

### Throw/Place Spell System

- Entity places (range 0-1) or throws (range 2+) a collectible item onto the board
- No damage component — purely for item placement
- Range 0: place on own tile, Range 1: adjacent tile, Range 2+: projectile with item sprite
- Projectile passes through entities (only stops at walls or max range)
- `placeCollectibleFromSpell()` in actions.ts creates the PlacedCollectible
- Grace period: 1-turn caster immunity by default (configurable), with permanent immunity toggle
- Immediate pickup: entity standing on landing tile picks it up right away (respecting permissions + grace)
- Item duration/despawn: optional `duration` field on all CustomCollectible (permanent by default)
  - `processCollectibleDurations()` in simulation.ts decrements each turn, triggers despawn
  - Scale-up animation on spawn (400ms easeOutBack), scale-down on despawn (400ms easeInBack)
  - Throw/Place spell can override duration, pickup permissions via `ThrowPlaceConfig`
- `PlacedCollectible` extended with: `spawnTurn`, `spawnTime`, `duration`, `despawning`, `despawnTime`, `placedByEntityId`, `placerImmuneUntilTurn`, `placerPermanentlyImmune`, `overridePermissions`, `sourceSpellId`
- ItemsDisplay shows "Thrown by" / "Placed by" badges with entity sprites and duration info
- Blocked by Silenced status effect (classified as ranged)

### Homing Projectile Path Styles

- `straight` - smooth line from caster to target (works well for fast projectiles)
- `grid` - tile-by-tile path following grid
- `pathfinding` - BFS pathfinding around walls
- `homingIgnoreWalls` - whether homing projectiles pass through walls
- `homingHitAlongPath` - whether grid/pathfinding can hit entities along the path (not just target)
- Health bar glow indicator for homing targets (red for damage, green for healing)

### Validator/Solver

- Async puzzle solver in MapEditor validates solvability
- Tests all character placement permutations
- For redirect spells with `redirectAcceptsUserInput`, tests all 8 direction permutations
- Headless mode uses `updateProjectilesHeadless()` (separate from visual projectile system)
- Shows optimal placement with redirect direction in validation modal

### Turn Execution Order (in `executeTurn`)

1. Process status effects (turn start)
2. Character actions
3. Enemy actions
4. `resolveProjectiles()` - projectile advancement and collision
5. Process status effects (turn end)
6. Check victory/defeat conditions

### Map Editor Autosave

- Flushes to localStorage on `useEffect` cleanup (handles Vite HMR)
- `beforeunload` handler for tab close

### Replay System

- Generates turn history via headless simulation
- Event timeline records projectile spawn/hit/reflect/deactivate events
- `buildReplayProjectiles()` reconstructs projectile visuals from events
- Step forward/backward plays one turn of animation then freezes
- `replayStepAnimating` flag controls the animation window
- `replayFrozen` prop on AnimatedGameBoard freezes `updateProjectiles`

## Pending Tasks

1. **Slow homing projectile visuals** - speed 1-2 homing spells do not visually track moving targets well. Need a separate visual approach for slow homing that does not break fast projectile behavior.
2. **Projectile system refactor** - clean up technical debt: extract helpers, eliminate duplicated collision logic, consolidate overlapping flags, make visual system truly read-only.
3. **Replay projectile polish** - edge cases with slow projectiles, melee VFX timing.
4. **Sentry environment variables** - add to Netlify player site.
5. **Run `007_player_roles.sql` migration** against Supabase.
6. **POST error on puzzle completion** - 400 Bad Request to `puzzle_completions` table, schema mismatch.

## Important Patterns

- **Deep copy issue**: `setGameState((prev) => { const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(prev)); executeTurn(copy); return copy; })` - the deep copy captures visual mutations from `updateProjectiles`. This is why `resolveProjectiles` uses `logicalTileIndex` (not `currentTileIndex`) and why reflected projectiles are skipped on subsequent turns.
- **Axiom**: Visuals must represent reality. The game is a puzzle - players plan based on what they see. Visual/logic mismatches are bugs, not cosmetic issues.
- **Determinism**: Same puzzle setup must produce the same result every run. The `resolveProjectiles` system at turn boundaries achieves this. Frame timing should never affect game outcomes.
- **Safe revert point**: Commit `e3b5b58` is the pre-deterministic state where everything worked visually (per-frame collision) but had rare frame-timing variance. Can always revert there if needed.
